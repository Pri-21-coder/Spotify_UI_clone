# Spotify_UI_clone
Author-Pritha Pal
 Recreated a Spotify-Inspired Music Web UI! 

Excited to share a unique mini project I’ve been working on — a Spotify-inspired music streaming interface, built entirely using HTML and CSS, with careful attention to layout, responsiveness, and modern UI principles.

This project challenged me to combine multiple core web concepts like: 

i. Flexbox Layouts.
ii. Custom Scrollbars & Hover Effects
iii. Responsive Design using Media Queries
iv. Clean and accessible HTML structure.
